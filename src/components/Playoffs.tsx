        When Michael Jordan competed in the postseason, he often wore dark shoes
        during road games to symbolize a stealthier approach to dominance.
        Inspired by that legacy—with nods to iconic OG Huarache and AJ7
        colourway—the Air Jordan XXXVII 'Playoffs' is built for game seven.
